PRE-REQUISITES

To use this, you need a Java JDK - I suggest you get JDK 1.4.2_06 from here 
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html

You no longer require a separate install of Apache Ant to use DELI, but if
you have Ant installed it is not a problem. 

=============================

ON WINDOWS

1. First you need to build DELI type

ant

Then there are various things you can do with DELI:

2. To validate all UAProf profiles in profiles.xml with a direct 
connection to the internet type

ant runUAProfValidator

3. To validate all UAProf profiles in profiles.xml behind a firewall type

ant runUAProfValidatorProxy -Dhttp.proxyHost=your proxy host -Dhttp.proxyPort=your proxy port

4. To validate a UAProf profile type

ant validate -Dprofile=your profile

5. To run the DELI hello world application build DELI, copy ccpp.war
to the webapps directory of your app server, and see your app server
documentation about how to deploy a web app. On Tomcat, the web app
will deploy automatically. Assuming your app server works on port 8088,
to see the hello world page point your web browser at 

http://localhost:8088/ccpp/index.html

ON LINUX

1. First you need to build DELI type

. ant.sh

3. To validate all UAProf profiles in profiles.xml behind a firewall type

. ant.sh runUAProfValidatorProxy -Dhttp.proxyHost=your proxy host -Dhttp.proxyPort=your proxy port
